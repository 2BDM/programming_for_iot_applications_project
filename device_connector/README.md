# Device Connector

This folder contains the main program, which runs the device connector for the raspberry pi.

## Working principle

The device connector consists in a program which on one side interfaces with the sensors and actuators to either publish MQTT messages or react to them, on the other must interface with the registry system (service and device catalog) to always keep the information updated.
